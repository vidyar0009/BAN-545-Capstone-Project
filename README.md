# BAN545 Capstone Project
Project Challenges and Resolutions:
The dataset used in the project initially presented dates in the "DD/MM/YYYY" format, but the project required dates in the "MM/DD/YYYY" format. Despite attempts to reformat, the issue persisted.
To resolve this, the team generated random dates within the range of 01/01/2015 to 01/01/2017 in the required format, allowing the project to proceed.
Additionally, ship dates were removed from the dataset as they were not relevant to the project.
Future Considerations:
For similar projects, selecting a dataset with a compatible date format would be a priority to avoid such issues.
